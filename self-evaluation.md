# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
In stead of calling a value in an array, you can call all the values. Thinking this could be usefull for evaluating data
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need more practice with conditionals! Still trying to wrap my head around the concepts completely.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
Having challenges, I really like opportunity to figure it out as best I can. Mostly because it's helping me work through constructivley struggling.
